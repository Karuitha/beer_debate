Web Scaping and Data Wrangling Project using data from www.beeradvocate.com
In this project I am practicing web scraping and data wrangling in R.
I scraped the data from www.beeradvocate.com
The data had the columns for beer name, brewers name, beer type, alcohol content and beer subtype all mixed up.
The challenge is to separate the data and get a clean set that has the columns separate.
